Step-by-Step Setup Using PHP's Built-in Server
Step 1: Install PHP

Ensure PHP is installed on your system. You can check if PHP is installed by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

sh
Copy code
php -v
If PHP is not installed, you can download and install it from PHP.net.

Windows: Use the Windows installer.
macOS: You can install PHP using Homebrew:
sh
Copy code
brew install php
Linux: Use your distribution's package manager, for example:
sh
Copy code
sudo apt-get install php
Step 2: Set Up Your Project Directory

Create a Project Directory:
Create a new directory for your project. You can name it anything you like:

sh
Copy code
mkdir my_php_project
cd my_php_project
Create a Subdirectory for Public Files:
Inside your project directory, create a public folder that will act as your document root:

sh
Copy code
mkdir public
Copy Your PHP Files to the Public Directory:
Place all your PHP files (index.php, review.php, add_edit_item.php, delete_item.php, manufacturers.php, items_by_manufacturer.php, add_review.php) inside the public directory.
Step 3: Set Up the Database

Install and Set Up MySQL:
If you donâ€™t have MySQL installed, you can download it from MySQL's official site or install it using a package manager:

sh
Copy code
# macOS
brew install mysql
# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
Start the MySQL Server:
Start the MySQL service:

sh
Copy code
# macOS
brew services start mysql
# Ubuntu
sudo service mysql start
Create a Database and Tables:
Open the MySQL command line interface (CLI) and create the database and tables:

sh
Copy code
mysql -u root -p
Then, run the following SQL commands:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE yourdbname;

USE yourdbname;

CREATE TABLE items (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    manufacturer VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE reviews (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    item_id INT NOT NULL,
    reviewer_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    rating INT CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
    review_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    review_date DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (item_id) REFERENCES items(id)
);
Configure Your PHP Files to Connect to MySQL:
Make sure your PHP files have the correct database credentials:

php
Copy code
// Replace 'yourdbname' with your database name and provide your username and password
$conn = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=yourdbname', 'username', 'password');
Step 4: Start PHP's Built-in Server

Open Your Terminal and Navigate to Your Project Directory:
Go to the root of your project (where you created the public directory):

sh
Copy code
cd my_php_project
Start PHP's Built-in Server:
Run the following command to start the PHP built-in server:

sh
Copy code
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
This command starts a local web server on localhost at port 8000 and sets the document root to the public directory. You should see an output similar to:

sh
Copy code
[Sun Sep  4 11:03:19 2024] PHP 8.0.2 Development Server (http://localhost:8000) started
Step 5: Access Your Application

Open Your Web Browser:
Go to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.
Test Your Application:
The homepage (index.php) should load and display a list of items.
You can navigate to other pages (like review.php, add_edit_item.php, etc.) by clicking links or directly accessing the URLs.
Step 6: Debugging and Stopping the Server

Stopping the Server: To stop the PHP server, press Ctrl + C in the terminal where the server is running.
Debugging: Any PHP errors or server logs will be displayed in the terminal window. This is useful for debugging issues in your code.
